# ML_Algorithms_Comparison_Study-Telco-Dataset
A comprehensive Machine Learning Algorithm Comparison Study. The project comprises python notebooks for individual machine learning algorithms, and a single python notebook for displaying evaluation reports of algorithms based on their accuracy, processing time and Confusion Matrix.

# Machine Learning Algorithms Applied in this Study:
1. Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier - GaussianNB
2. K - Nearest Neighbors - KNN
3. Decision Tree Classifier - Pruned and Unprunded Trees
4. Support Vector Machines -Sigmoid and RBF

# Notes:
1. Support Vector Machine with Linear Kernel in not included in this study because it takes comprehensive processing time for huge datasets. In the case of this dataset SVM with Linear kernel gives 80% Accuracy but takes a lot of time. For experimentation purposes, SVM with linear kernel is included in indvidual algorithms.

2. In decision Tree Classifier, the visualization of Unpruned tree may take time and the visualization of Pruned tree is comparatively fast due to default depth taken as 3.

3. In KNN, the 7-nearest neighbours are taken into consideration.

4. All these parameters can be changed and played with to observe their effects on the algorithms accuracy.

5. Scikit learn is the primary library used for this Study.

6. For more information on machine learning algorithms and sklearn, kindly visit the documentation at https://scikit-learn.org/


# The Python Notebooks were created and executed on Google Colaboratory
It is best advised to use the python notebooks in google colab to achieve best results.

# The Telco Dataset used in this study was downloaded and used from Kaggle Datasets.
