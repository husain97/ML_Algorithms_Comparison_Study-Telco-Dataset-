# ML_Algorithms_Comparison_Study-Telco-Dataset
A comprehensive Machine Learning Algorithm Comparison Study. The project comprises python notebooks for individual machine learning algorithms, and a single python notebook for displaying evaluation reports of algorithms based on their accuracy, processing time and Confusion Matrix.

# The Python Notebooks were created and executed on Google Colaboratory
It is best advised to use the python notebooks in google colab to achieve best results.

# The Telco Dataset used in this study was downloaded and used from Kaggle Datasets.
